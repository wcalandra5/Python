### Keywords - W3 schools has a useful guide for this
# and - the boolean and, both must be True for and to be True
# del - delete from dictionary - del object, deletes that object from memory
# from - importing specific parts from a module/library - import X from Y
# not - the boolean not, to negate the expression - not False evaluates to True
# while - for the while loop - while X < Y:
# as - creates an alias for an object - import calendar as c -- then you refer to the calendar module as c. for functions
# elif - the else-if statement -- elif x == False:
# global - declare that you want a global variable from inside a function --- global x
# or - the boolean or, at least one must be True for or to evaluate to True
# with - can use it in a with (something) as (something else) to rename something - allows you to abstract
# assert - make sure that something is True, you will get an error if it is not True - great for debugging
# else - the else statement at the end of each if ---- else:
# if - the if statement --- if x == 5:
# pass - it is a null statement, to be used as a placeholder for future code - nothing happens, you just don't get an error -- def myFunction(): pass
# yield - ends a function, returns a value to the caller, can let a function resume where it left off - makes a "generator"
# break - breaks out of a loop, ends it --- if i > 3: break
# except - if an exception happens, do this -- like how we've been using else, for handling exceptions
# import - import a module -- import sys from argv
# print - print what is there
# class - define a class --- class Person: body
# exec - run a string as Python code
# in - part of for loops, also a test to see if X is in Y
# raise - raise an exception when things go wrong - C++'s throw
# continue - skip over this part of the loop and continue - continue to next iteration of loop
# finally - used with exceptions, a block of code that will be executed no matter if there is an exception or not - used with try blocks to signal their ending
# is - test if variables are equal - x is y
# return - the return statement in a function
# def - to define a function
# for - the start of a for loop
# lambda - create an anonymous function - can take any number of arguments, but can only have one expression - like a useful tool
# try - the start of a try - except statement - decide when to raise an error

### Data types
# True - boolean value True -- True == True 
# False - boolean value False -- False -- True
# None - represents nothing or no value - like a null -- x = None
# strings - store text -- "David"
# numbers - store numeric data, integers --- 5
# floats - store decimals -- 5.0
# lists - store list  --- [1,2,"David"]


### Escape sequences
# \\  ---- \ backslash
# \' ----- ' single-quote
# \" ------ " double-quote
# \a ----- Bel
# \b ----- Backspace
# \f ---- formfeed
# \n ---- newline
# \r ----- carriage - like a new line
# \t ---- tab
# \v ---- vertical tab

### String formats
# %d - decimal integers - not floats
# %i - same as %d
# %o - octal number - uses digits 0 to 7
# %u - unsigned decimal - for negatives
# %x - hexadecimal lowercase - 1000 == 3e8
# %X - hexadecimal uppercase - 1000 == 3E8
# %e - exponential notation - 1000 == 1e+03
# %E - same as e, but e is uppercase
# %f - floating point real number - 10.34
# %F - same as %f
# %g - either %f or %e, whichever is shorter
# %G - same as %g but with uppercase
# %c - character format - convert to characters
# %r - raw data
# %s - string format
# %% - a percent sign added to end -- 10.34 --> 10.34%

### Operators
# + --- addition
# - --- subtraction
# * -- multiplication
# / -- division
# // -- floor division - 2 // 4 == 0
# % -- modulus
# < -- less than
# > -- greater than
# <= --- less than or equal to
# >= --- greater than or equal to
# == --- equality
# != --- not equal
# <> --- deprecated, not equal
# () --- parenthesis
# [] --- list brackets
# {} ---- dictionary, curly braces {x: 5, y: 10}
# @ --- at -- @classmethod
# , --- comma
# : --- colon for functions
# . --- dot for hierarchy
# = --- assignment
# ; --- semi-colon for combining lines of code
# += --- add and assign
# -= --- subtract and assign
# *= --- multiply and assign
# /= --- divide and assign
# //= --- floor divide and assign
# %= --- modulus and assign
# **= --- power and assign --- 7**2 is 49
